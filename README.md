Description:

The "Digital Clock" project is a simple web-based application that displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds. It provides a visually appealing digital clock interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML:
- The HTML structure contains a container with a clock element inside it.
- The clock element displays the hours, minutes, and seconds separated by colons.
- Each time component (hours, minutes, seconds) is represented by a span element with an id to target it in JavaScript.

CSS:
- The CSS file styles the digital clock interface to make it visually appealing.
- It sets the background gradient for the hero section, giving it a colorful background.
- The clock container is positioned in the center of the hero section using absolute positioning and transforms.
- Styling is applied to the clock elements, including font size, colors, and positioning, to create an attractive display.

JavaScript:
- The JavaScript code fetches the hours, minutes, and seconds from the system clock using the Date object.
- It updates the content of the corresponding HTML span elements with the current time values.
- The setInterval function is used to update the clock display every second, ensuring real-time updates.

Overall, the "Digital Clock" project provides a simple yet effective way to display the current time in a visually appealing manner on a web page. It can be easily integrated into websites or applications to enhance user experience and provide useful functionality.
